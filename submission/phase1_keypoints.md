# Phase 1: Keypoints Extraction

## Problem Statement
- Transformer models with Multi-Head Attention (MHA) are growing exponentially in size
- Traditional MHA parallelization only splits attention heads across devices
- This approach becomes suboptimal when number of devices exceeds number of heads
- Leads to communication bottlenecks and suboptimal hardware utilization

## Key Contribution
- Novel two-level partitioning method for MHA layers
- Combines head-level partitioning with intra-head dimension-level partitioning
- Enables deployment across m×n devices (where m = dimension splits, n = head groups)
- Achieves improved scalability and hardware utilization

## Technical Innovation
- First work to explicitly combine head-wise splitting with dimension-wise slicing inside heads
- Creates m×n partitions that can be mapped to m×n devices
- Reduces communication overhead through localized computations
- Enables flexible scaling beyond traditional head-wise splitting limits

## Key Results
- Tested on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs
- Compared against Tensor Parallelism (TP=8) + Pipeline Parallelism (PP=2) baseline
- Dense Transformer: 31.7% throughput improvement (1.2M → 1.58M tokens/sec)
- MoE Transformer: 35.3% throughput improvement (850K → 1.15M tokens/sec)
- Communication overhead reduced by 33-37%
- Uses FP16 precision with batch size 1024

## Impact
- Enables efficient deployment of very large models across numerous devices
- Better load balancing through dual-level partitioning
- Reduced memory footprint per device
- Supports both training and inference scenarios
